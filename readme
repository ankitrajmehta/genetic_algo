## Current Selection critera:

    ### For first 20 generation:
            Fitness+=1 if individual is in the right side of map (x > 90) between steps 100 to 200
            Fitness -= 1 if individual is still in the left side of map between steps 100 to 200

    ### For Next 80 gen:
            Fitness+=1 if individual is in the right side of map (x > 90) between steps 100 to 200
            Fitness -= 1 if individual is still in the left side of map between steps 100 to 200
            Fitness += 1 if individual is in the left side of map (x<10) between steps 300 to 400
            Fitness -= 1 if individual is still in the right side of map between steps 300 to 400

## Expected result:
        First, up to 20th generation, fitness increases. At 21st generation, it sharply decreases. It takes a few generations to start getting positive fitness again.
